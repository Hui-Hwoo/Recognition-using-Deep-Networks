# Recognition-using-Deep-Networks

The objective of this project is to build, train, analyze, and modify a deep neural network for the recognition task using the MNIST digit dataset. The project involves tasks such as building and training the network, visualizing the dataset, making the network code repeatable, designing the network model, and training the model for five epochs. 

If encounter any problems, please feel free to contact us via email hu.hui1@northeastern.edu

# How to run the code

## Train model

In the treminal, enter command `python main.py train` to compile and run py files


## Examine model

In the treminal, enter command `python main.py examine` to compile and run py files


## Transfer model

In the treminal, enter command `python main.py transfer` to compile and run py files

## Experiment model

In the treminal, enter command `python main.py experiment` to compile and run py files

## Extension part

In the treminal, enter command `python main.py extension` to compile and run py files


# Tips

- For your convenience, all plotted images will automatically save to `results/` directory, rather than displaying on the screen

- You can run the code by terminal commands using default parameters, but if you wanna change the value of parameters, like batch_size, epochs, please change the value in corresponding .py files. 

- Program may have some delays, thank you for your patience :)
